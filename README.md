Coursework for course https://hy-tsoha.github.io/materiaali/

This project is a rather straightforward copy of an existing media application Reddit https://www.reddit.com/.

There are many possible features for this app so it depends largely on the scope of this course.

The main features would at least be:

* Users can make profiles, login and logout 
* Users can join different communities and create them
* Users can post text based threads on these communities
* Users can leave messages on these threads
* Communities have admins who have the right to take down threads, remove messages and ban users from entering these communities
* Users can upvote threads and messages which affects their visibility
* Users can select from what time period to see threads (today, week, month, year, all)
* Users can search for their communities and new communities
* Users can search for different threads

(If any instructors find the scope too narrow please inform me as soon as possible so I can plan more effectively future features)
